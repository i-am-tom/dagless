Dagless is a DSL for constructing heterogenous computations representable as
[DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph). Specifically, it
uses an [IxStateT
transformer](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/indexed-extras/docs/Control-Monad-Indexed-State.html)
to keep track of updates to the graph. When combined with the fabulous
[`do-notation`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/do-notation) package,
however, this implementation detail is neatly hidden away!
